_More detailed usage steps will be added as development progresses._

## Overview

Sortify is a simple, lightweight C application that visualizes popular sorting
algorithms in real time. Built using [alfredbaudisch/raylib-cimgui](https://github.com/alfredbaudisch/raylib-cimgui),
the program provides an interactive way to explore, learn, and understand the
inner workings of classic sorting techniques.

Whether you're a student, educator, or just a curious developer, this visualizer
makes it easy to see how data moves and transforms during each step of a sorting process.

### Supported Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
